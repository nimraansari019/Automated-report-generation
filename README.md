#  Task 2 â€“ Student Report Card Generator

###  Project Overview

This project focuses on automating the generation of **student report cards** using Python. Traditionally, teachers prepare report cards manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project solves that problem by reading student marks from a **CSV file** and generating **personalized PDF report cards** for each student. The script also displays the studentâ€™s performance details on the terminal so that the user can verify the output.

The generated reports include the studentâ€™s name, marks in different subjects, total score, average marks, and the final result (Pass/Fail). The PDFs are formatted with a proper title, table, and layout for easy readability.



### âš™ Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python 3.12** â†’ Core programming language.
* **CSV Module** â†’ Reads student data from a CSV file (`students.csv`).
* **FPDF Library** â†’ Creates well-formatted PDF report cards.
* **OS Module** â†’ Handles file saving and prevents overwriting errors.
* **Text Editor / IDE** â†’ Python IDLE and Jupyter Notebook were used for writing and testing code.

### ðŸ›  Implementation Details

1. **CSV Input File (`students.csv`)**

   * The CSV file stores student names and their marks in subjects (Maths, Science, English).
   * Example:

---
     Name,Maths,Science,English
     Ali,78,85,92
     Sara,56,61,74
     Rohan,40,35,50
     ```

2. **Python Script (`report_generator.py`)**

   * Reads each studentâ€™s marks from the CSV file.
   * Calculates:

     * **Total Marks**
     * **Average Marks**
     * **Result (Pass/Fail)**
   * Displays details in the terminal for verification.
   * Creates a **PDF Report Card** with a formatted table.

3. **PDF Report Card**
   Each student receives a PDF file named after them (e.g., `Ali_report.pdf`).

   * Contains:

     * School Title
     * Academic Year
     * Student Name
     * Marks in each subject
     * Total & Average
     * Pass/Fail Result

### Example Output

**Terminal Output**

```
---------
Name    : Ali
Maths   : 78
Science : 85
English : 92
Total   : 255
Average : 85.0
Result  : Pass
Report saved as: Ali_report.pdf
---------
```

**Sample PDF (Ali\_report.pdf)**

```
ABC School â€“ Report Card
Academic Year: 2024â€“2025

Subject   Marks
Maths     78
Science   85
English   92
Total     255
Average   85.0
Result    Pass
```

###  Applications

* **Schools & Colleges** â†’ Automates student report generation.
* **Coaching Institutes** â†’ Quick progress reports for multiple students.
* **Corporate Training** â†’ Can be adapted for employee performance tracking.
* **Personal Use** â†’ Parents can track childâ€™s academic performance.

---

###  Project Outcome

* Automated **report card creation** from CSV data.
* Reduced manual work and improved **accuracy**.
* Created **well-formatted PDFs** using Python.
* Ensured scalability â†’ Works for any number of students by just updating the CSV file.

This project demonstrates how Python can be used in **real-world education systems** to save time and reduce errors.
